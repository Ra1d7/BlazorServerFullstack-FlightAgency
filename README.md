# Flight

Flight is a Blazor Server website project for a fictional travel agency.
- The project features a front-end developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Razor Pages, and Bootstrap with jQuery.
- The backend includes an API with JWT Bearer token authentication and policy authorization based on roles for clients and admins.
- Each role has access to its respective api endpoints.
- A SQL Server database is used with stored procedures to perform CRUD operations and querying and filtering data between the front-end and API using ADO.NET.
